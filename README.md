# Wars
3D game made with babylon.js

the controls are:
  movement = mouse1, mouse2, mouse wheel
  pause = space
  esc = menu

gameplay: add units to spawn queue to try and destroy the enemy's nexus.

bug:
  the first time you start the game you need to refresh the page. "the indexdb is not created well the first time"
  big resolutions break the game ex: 4K
